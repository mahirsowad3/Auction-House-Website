## How to Navigate Through the Application and Test This Iteration's Use-Cases

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. Do NOT refresh/reload the application once there through the link as that will break the application's functionality.
2. When accessing certain pages on the application such as "view active items", "review items", other similar pages, or when viewing a specific item, items past their bid or purchase end date will automatically become completed or failed depending on the conditions described on the "FINALIZED" version of the use-cases before any of the items and their contents show up.
3. Despite what is said on the README regarding each use-case, it is important to take into consideration what is described on the "FINALIZED" version of the use-cases as to why the condition behaves in certain ways when certain actions are taken by the user.
4. You will be treated as a Customer until you log in as either a seller or buyer. If you log out of your account at any point, you will be treated as a Customer again until you log back in as either a seller or buyer.
5. Do NOT use the username "Admin1" when creating an account as that username is already taken
6. To log in as the auction house's "Admin" side, use the username "Admin1" and password "Admin1", both without the quotes and while ensuring the correct capitalization.
7. On the "Reports" page on the Admin, the "Total Funds:" section represents the required generated auction report, and the "auction forensics" section represents the required generated forensics report.
8. While we don't expect there to be any, to avoid any unforeseen issues, we recommend running our application inside of an incognito window of your browser.
